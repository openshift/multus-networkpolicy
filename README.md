# multi-networkpolicy-iptables

[multi-networkpolicy](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multi-networkpolicy) implementation with iptables

## Current Status of the Repository

It is now actively developping hence not stable yet. Bug report and feature request are welcome.

## Description

Kubernetes provides [Network Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) for network security. Currently net-attach-def does not support Network Policies because net-attach-def is CRD, user defined resources, outside of Kubernetes.
multi-network policy implements Network Policiy functionality for net-attach-def, by iptables and provies network security for net-attach-def networks.

## Quickstart

Install MultiNetworkPolicy CRD into Kubernetes.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multi-networkpolicy
$ cd multi-networkpolicy
$ kubectl create -f scheme.yml
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/multi-networkpolicies.k8s.cni.cncf.io created
```

Deploy multi-networkpolicie-iptables into Kubernetes.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multi-networkpolicy-iptables
$ cd multi-networkpolicy-iptables
$ kubectl create -f deploy.yml
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/multi-networkpolicy created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/multi-networkpolicy created
serviceaccount/multi-networkpolicy created
daemonset.apps/multi-networkpolicy-ds-amd64 created
```

## Demo

(TBD)

### MultiNetworkPolicy DaemonSet

MultiNetworkPolicy creates DaemonSet and it runs `multi-networkpolicy-iptables` for each node. `multi-networkpolicy-iptables` watches MultiNetworkPolicy object and creates iptables rules into 'pod's network namespace', not container host and the iptables rules filters packets to interface, based on MultiNetworkPolicy.

## TODO

* Bugfixing
* IPv6 support
* (TBD)
